### Project Goals
The goal of this project is to predict flight delays and cancellations leaving out of San Diego International Airport, by integrating 2 eyars worth of on time flight arrival data collected from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, in conjunction with meteorological data collected from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI) Integrated Surface Database which contains information on every weather report from certified weather reporting stations around the world, including San Diego International Airport which is abbreviated KSAN.
